# Spectacles-Detection
A lightweight, high-accuracy deep learning model designed to detect whether a person is wearing glasses or not, even when the face is tilted up to 75° and under some edge cases such as low light environments, blurred images etc.

🎯 Objective
To build a compact yet accurate glasses detection model using deep learning that:

Achieves ≥ 85% accuracy
Works on angled faces (up to 75°)
Is optimized for deployment with TensorFlow Lite
Has a model size of ≤ 30MB

🚀 Approach
1. Dataset
CelebA dataset with 200K+ celebrity images
Binary labels: Eyeglasses → {1: Glasses, 0: No Glasses}
Used official train/val/test splits
2. Preprocessing
Label conversion and metadata creation
Images resized to 128x128
Normalized pixel values to [0,1]
3. Class Imbalance
Computed and used class_weight during training to handle imbalance between "glasses" and "no glasses" classes
4. Model Architecture
Base: MobileNetV2 (ImageNet pretrained)
Custom head: GAP → Dense(128, ReLU) → BatchNorm → Dropout(0.4) → Dense(1, Sigmoid)
5. Augmentation
Custom augmentations for angle robustness:
Rotation (±45°), brightness/contrast shifts
Horizontal flips, random crops, Gaussian noise
6. Training Strategy
Phase 1: Train custom head with base frozen
Phase 2: Fine-tune base model with lower learning rate
Early stopping and LR scheduling used for stability
7. Evaluation
Evaluated on held-out test set and individual images
Consistent performance across batch and real-world inferences

📌 If you want to run the project from scratch -
1. Clone this repo
git clone my repo(___________ _________)
cd Spectacles-Detection
2. Create a Virtual Environment
Run the following command to create a new virtual environment in the project directory:

python -m venv venv
Activate the Virtual Environment

On Windows:
.\venv\Scripts\activate
On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
3. Install Dependencies
Once the virtual environment is activated, install the required dependencies from requirements.txt:

pip install -r requiremnts.txt
4. Preprocess the dataset
Download the CelebA dataset and extract it from Kaggle [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessicali9530/celeba-dataset]
Update paths in preprocessing.ipynb
Run the notebook to generate metadata and verify images
5. Train the model
python train.py
6. Convert to TensorFlow Lite
python convert_to_tflite.py
7. Evaluate
Run the various scripts available to test out the final .tflite model!
